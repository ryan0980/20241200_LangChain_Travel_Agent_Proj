      "Many of Washington, D.C.'s main attractions relate to its principal enterprise: politics. These include the White House and the U.S. Capitol, of course, as well as monuments and historic sites dedicated to notable historical figures. The capital is also a destination for museumgoers. The Smithsonian Institute operates more than 20 museums (most free to visit!), including the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the National Air and Space Museum and the National Museum of American History. It also runs the family-friendly National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the traditional attractions, you'll find many nontouristy things to do. You can spend your morning perusing the city's farmers markets and your afternoon taking in the scenery from the National Mall before catching a show at The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The city also has lively nightlife scenes – check out the 9:30 Club, for instance. If you plan to visit in March or April, don't miss wandering along the Tidal Basin, where you'll find thousands of pink cherry blossoms, not to mention excellent weather for exploring the city's neighborhoods.\n",
      "\n",
      "For an effective way to take in the city’s highlights, consider one of D.C.'s various bus tours, some of which are of the hop-on, hop-off variety (and some of which use double-decker vehicles with open-top upper decks). Tour durations vary from as little as 90 minutes to full-day affairs.' metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ryan0\\\\OneDrive\\\\Obsidian_Lib\\\\11_GWU\\\\13_24FA\\\\CSCI_6365_A_ML\\\\20241113_AML_Final_Proj\\\\data\\\\attraction_resource\\\\DC_attraction.txt'}\n",

      "If you've never been to Washington, D.C. before, plan to spend some time along the Tidal Basin, an approximately 107-acre pond encircled by a 2.1-mile loop trail. Constructed to use the strong tides of the Potomac River to clear silt from the Washington Channel and to maintain steady water levels in the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pools, it now also serves as the backdrop to some of D.C.'s best-loved sites. Every spring, the Tidal Basin bursts with color as cherry blossom trees (gifted to the city from Tokyo) bloom into cotton candy-colored tufts, and they attract hordes of visitors. The cherry blossoms typically hit peak bloom (defined as when 70% of the cherry blossoms are open) in March or April. The National Park Service website makes \"bloom watch\" updates on its website, where you can check the progress of the trees and see when peak bloom is expected for the year. You can follow the path that leads around the basin, but recent visitors recommended testing the waters in a paddleboat. Paddleboats are available to rent from spring until fall for $28 to $40 per hour (depending on the day) for a four-passenger boat. You can pick up a paddle boat on weekdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on weekends from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from the boat dock near Maine Avenue.' metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ryan0\\\\OneDrive\\\\Obsidian_Lib\\\\11_GWU\\\\13_24FA\\\\CSCI_6365_A_ML\\\\20241113_AML_Final_Proj\\\\data\\\\attraction_resource\\\\DC_attraction.txt'}\n",

      "Standing just shy of 555 ½ feet, the Washington Monument was the tallest structure in the world at its completion in 1884. Nowadays, you can ride one of the monument's glass-encased elevators to the top observation deck to enjoy 360-degree views of the city, which invariably impress visitors. You can explore the attraction's exterior for free 24 hours a day, but National Park Service rangers are only available from 9:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. to answer questions. The monument itself is open to visitors every day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free timed-entry tickets can be reserved up to 30 days in advance via Recreation.gov. (There is a $1 nonrefundable service charge for each ticket.) Some same-day tickets are distributed daily on a first-come, first served basis. The ticket window opens at 8:45 a.m.; be prepared for a line. The Smithsonian Metro stop is closest to the monument.
